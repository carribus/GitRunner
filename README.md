# GitRunner

GitRunner was designed and developed for the Global Hack Summit Hackathon of 2016.

The idea behind the game is to generate dynamically an infinite runner map based on metrics of GitHub repositories.

Or how we like to say:


```
    if (gitRunner == infiniteRunnerGame &&
        mapSize == sizeOfAGitHubRepository &&
        obstacles ==  mostUsedLanguageSize &&
        monsters == noOfSubscribers &&
        gaps == noOfBrances) {
            funFunGame(play);
        }
```
